 Codeable concepts handle missing codings differently depending on whether:
 1) The minimum cardinality
 2) The binding strength
 The default minimum cardinality is 0, as in, it is not required.
 The default binding strength is undefined. However this is only important in the case when the binding is "required". In that case the coding must come from the specified value set.
